## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your Genesy campaigns. Instead of polling the API for updates, Genesy will send HTTP POST requests to your specified URL whenever subscribed events happen.

Think of webhooks as "reverse API calls" - Genesy calls your application when something interesting happens, like a contact replying to a message or accepting a connection request.

## How Webhooks Work

1. **Create a subscription**: Tell Genesy which events you want to track and where to send them
2. **Genesy monitors events**: As your campaigns run, Genesy watches for the events you subscribed to
3. **Receive notifications**: When an event occurs, Genesy sends a POST request to your URL with event details
4. **Process the data**: Your application receives and processes the webhook payload

## Available Events

| Event Type                       | Triggered When                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CONNECTION_REQUEST_SENT`        | A LinkedIn connection request is sent to a contact          |
| `CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED`    | A contact accepts a LinkedIn connection request             |
| `LINKEDIN_MESSAGE_SENT`          | A LinkedIn message is sent to a contact                     |
| `EMAIL_SENT`                     | An email is sent to a contact                               |
| `INMAIL_SENT`                    | A LinkedIn InMail is sent to a contact                      |
| `MESSAGE_REPLIED`                | A contact replies to a message (LinkedIn, email, or InMail) |
| `POST_LIKED`                     | A LinkedIn post is liked                                    |
| `PROFILE_VISITED`                | A LinkedIn profile is visited                               |

## Managing Webhooks

You can manage your webhook subscriptions in two ways:

1. **From the Dashboard**: Visit [app.genesy.ai/api-access](https://app.genesy.ai/api-access) to create, view, update, and delete subscriptions with a visual interface
2. **Via API**: Use the `/v1/webhooks` endpoints to programmatically manage subscriptions, view delivery logs, and more

## Creating a Webhook Subscription

You can create webhook subscriptions from [the API](https://docs.genesy.ai/api-reference/webhooks/create-webhook-subscription) or from the [dasboard](https://app.genesy.ai/api-access).

**Parameters:**

- `name` (required): Identifier for your webhook subscription
- `url` (required): Your endpoint URL where webhooks will be sent
- `events` (required): Array of event types to subscribe to
- `secret` (optional): A secret key that will be sent in the `X-Webhook-Secret` header for authentication
- `campaignIds` (optional): Only receive events from specific campaigns. If empty or not provided, you'll receive events from all campaigns
- `customFields` (optional): Additional contact/company fields to include in the webhook payload

## Webhook Payload Example

When a connection request is sent, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "eventType": "CONNECTION_REQUEST_SENT",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-03T10:30:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "contact": {
      "id": 789,
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "professionalEmail": "john.doe@example.com",
      "linkedInProfileUrl": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe",
      "jobTitle": "CEO",
      "companyId": 123
    },
    "campaign": {
      "id": 456,
      "name": "Outbound Campaign Q4",
      "status": "ACTIVE"
    },
    "customMessage": "Hi John, I would like to connect with you",
    "sentAt": "2025-11-03T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Testing Your Webhook

### Quick Test with `webhook.site`

Before building your endpoint, test with [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/):

1. Go to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) - you'll get a unique URL
2. Copy the generated URL
3. Create a webhook subscription pointing to that URL:
4. Trigger an event in your campaign (or use the test endpoint below)
5. Watch the webhook appear in real-time on webhook.site

### Test Webhook Endpoint

Send a test payload to verify your webhook is configured correctly. This sends a sample event to your webhook URL so you can verify it's receiving data properly.

## Best Practices

### Respond Quickly

Your endpoint should respond with a `2xx` status code within a few seconds. Process data asynchronously if needed.

### Verify the Secret

Always verify the webhook secret to ensure requests are from Genesy.

### Handle Retries Gracefully

Genesy retries failed deliveries (30s, 5min, 50min). Make your endpoint idempotent.

### Monitor Delivery Logs

Regularly check delivery logs from the [API Access dashboard](https://app.genesy.ai/api-access) or via the API to catch and fix issues.

## Common Use Cases

### Sync Replies to CRM

Update your CRM when contacts reply:

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.your-company.com/webhooks/update-crm",
  "secret": "your-secret",
  "events": ["MESSAGE_REPLIED"],
  "customFields": ["salesforceId", "hubspotId"]
}
```

### Track Campaign Performance

Monitor all outreach activity in real-time:

```json
{
  "url": "https://analytics.your-company.com/webhooks/track",
  "events": [
    "CONNECTION_REQUEST_SENT",
    "CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED",
    "LINKEDIN_MESSAGE_SENT",
    "EMAIL_SENT",
    "MESSAGE_REPLIED"
  ],
  "campaignIds": [789]
}
```

### Notify Sales Team

Send Slack notifications when contacts reply:

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-api.com/webhooks/notify-slack",
  "events": ["MESSAGE_REPLIED", "CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED"]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| ----- | -------- |
| Not receiving webhooks | Check delivery logs, verify your URL is publicly accessible |
| Webhooks timing out | Respond with 200 immediately, process data asynchronously |
| Duplicate events | Implement idempotency using event timestamp + type as unique key |
| Missing data | Add `customFields` to your subscription |
| Unknown webhook source | Verify `X-Webhook-Secret` header matches your secret |
