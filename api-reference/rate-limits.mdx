## How It Works

Rate limits are enforced using the following rules:

- **Per API Key & Endpoint**: Rate limits are calculated individually for each API key and endpoint combination
- **Rolling Window**: Limits are enforced in 60-second rolling windows
- **Blocking Period**: When you exceed the limit, you'll be blocked for 60 seconds
- **Usage Tracking**: Each API request returns rate limit headers to help you track your usage

## Response Headers

Every API response includes the following headers to help you monitor your rate limit status:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum number of requests allowed in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Number of requests remaining in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset-Seconds` | Unix timestamp when your rate limit will reset |

### Example Response Headers

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 75
X-RateLimit-Reset-Seconds: 1760534477
```

## Rate Limit Exceeded

When you exceed your rate limit, the API will:

- Return a **429 Too Many Requests** status code
- Include an `X-RateLimit-Retry-After-Seconds` header indicating when you can retry
- Return the following error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after the specified time."
}
```

<Note>
  **Authentication Required**: All requests must include a valid API key in the `x-api-key` header. Requests without an API key will receive a **401 Unauthorized** response.
