## Batch Operations

<Info>
  Genesy uses batch endpoints to minimize API calls and improve performance. Instead of making individual requests for each task, Genesy will batch multiple operations into single requests.
</Info>

### Get Tasks Batch

```http
POST /tasks/batch
```

#### Request Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ids` | string[] | ✅ Yes | Array of task IDs to retrieve |

#### Example Request

```json
{
  "ids": ["task-abc123", "task-def456", "task-ghi789"]
}
```

#### Response

Return an array of tasks. Tasks that don't exist should be omitted from the response (don't return errors for missing tasks).

```json
[
  {
    "id": "task-abc123",
    "subject": "Follow up with John",
    "completed": false
  },
  {
    "id": "task-def456",
    "subject": "Send proposal",
    "completed": true,
    "completedAt": "2024-01-15T11:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

<Tip>
  If a task ID doesn't exist, simply omit it from the response array rather than returning an error.
