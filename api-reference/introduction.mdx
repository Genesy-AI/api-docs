## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Your API key must be included in the request header `x-api-key` for every API call.

### API Key Format

API keys follow a standardized format and begin with the prefix `gsk_`. You can generate and manage your API keys through the api dashboard.

```bash
x-api-key: gsk_your_api_key_here
```

### API Key Management

API Keys can be managed through the API Dashboard. Keys can be revoked or assigned/removed scopes.

## Scopes and Permissions

API keys are assigned specific scopes that determine their access level and permissions. Each key must have at least one scope to function properly.

<Warning>
  API keys without assigned scopes will not have any permissions and all requests will be denied.
</Warning>

### Available Scopes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ALL" icon="unlock">
    Grants full access to all API endpoints and operations. This scope provides unrestricted access to your account resources.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="IDENTITIES_READ" icon="eye">
    Provides read-only access to identity-related endpoints. Keys with this scope can retrieve identity data but cannot create, update, or delete records.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  For security best practices, we recommend using the most restrictive scope necessary for your use case. Avoid using the `ALL` scope unless your integration requires full account access.
