## Welcome

Welcome to the Genesy API Reference! Here you'll find documentation for all available endpoints, authentication methods, and permissions. Use this section to explore how to integrate Genesy into your application, automate workflows, and unlock the full potential of our platform.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Your API key must be included in the request header `x-api-key` for every API call.

### API Key Format

API keys follow a standardized format and begin with the prefix `gsk_`. You can generate and manage your API keys through the api dashboard.

```bash
x-api-key: gsk_your_api_key_here
```

### API Key Management

API Keys can be managed through the API Dashboard. Keys can be revoked or assigned/removed scopes.

## Scopes and Permissions

API keys are assigned specific scopes that determine their access level and permissions. Each key must have at least one scope to function properly.

<Warning>
  API keys without assigned scopes will not have any permissions and all requests will be denied.
</Warning>

### Available Scopes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ALL" icon="unlock">
    Grants full access to all API endpoints and operations. This scope provides unrestricted access to your account resources.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="IDENTITIES_READ" icon="eye">
    Provides read-only access to identity-related endpoints. Keys with this scope can retrieve identity data but cannot create, update, or delete records.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  For security best practices, we recommend using the most restrictive scope necessary for your use case. Avoid using the `ALL` scope unless your integration requires full account access.
